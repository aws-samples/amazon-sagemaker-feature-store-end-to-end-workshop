    "ML Lineage racking from datasource to model endpoint, The challenge of reproducibility and lineage in machine learning (ML) is three-fold: code lineage, data lineage, and model lineage. Source version control is a standard for managing changes to code. For data lineage, most data storage services support versioning, which gives you the ability to track datasets at a given point in time. Model lineage combines code lineage, data lineage, and ML-specific information such as Docker containers used for training and deployment, model hyperparameters, and more.<strong><a style=\"color: #0397a7 \" href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/model-and-data-lineage-in-machine-learning-experimentation/\">\n",
