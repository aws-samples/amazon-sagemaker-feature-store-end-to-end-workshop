    "## Background\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to retrieve features from two online feature groups within an endpoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we use the feature sets derived and ingested to online features stores in Modules 1 and 2 as well as the model trained in module 3 that was a SageMaker XGBoost binary classifier algorithm predicting whether a given product is added by a user to their basket.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will  deploy the already trained model from the model artifact on to a SageMaker endpoint for real-time inference. Our endpoint will get the features from two online features groups (customers and products feature groups created in Module 2). By sending the request body as customer id and product id we retrieve the associated features from customer and product feature groups from low latency online feature stores and send them to the model endpoint for real-time inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we will create a custom inference script, and specify the feature groups as well as features. We Utilise a custom library (helper.py) that faciliates returning the resutls from featurestore using some helper functions. The returned result is then fed into the model for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a few minutes reviewing the following architecture:\n",
