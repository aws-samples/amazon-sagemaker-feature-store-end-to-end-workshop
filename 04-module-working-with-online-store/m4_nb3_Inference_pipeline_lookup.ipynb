    "## Background\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to retreive features from two online feature groups within an endpoint. First we use the feature set derived in Modules 1 and 2 as well as the model trained in module 3 that was a SageMaker XGBoost algorithm predicting which product the user would add to their baskets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retreiving the already trained model, we will create an inference pipline [Inference pipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/inference-pipelines.html). Using inference pipeline you can chain a sequence of 2 to 15 containers and delpoy on the same endpoint- Inference pipeline are great for real time inferences where a sequence of models feed into one another to generate the final prediction, or where pre-processing or post-processing of restuls in real time are requiered. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will see how we can use a XGBoost container as the first container within the inference pipeline to look up features from online features stores and feed the retreived features into a second XGboost container for model inference. You will also see how we delpoy these two container onto the same endpoint via using inference pipelineModel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first XGBoost contianer will get the features from two online features stores (customers and products feature groups created in Module 2) by sending the request body as customer id and product id to retreive their associated features from customer and product feature groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a few minutes reviewing the following architecture that shows an exmaple of an inference pipeline with multiple container.\n",
