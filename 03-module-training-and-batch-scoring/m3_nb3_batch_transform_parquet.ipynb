    "After the model is trained, if the goal is to generate predictions on a large dataset where minimizing latency isn't a concern, then SageMaker batch transform is the solution. Functionally, batch transform uses the same mechanics as real-time hosting to generate predictions. It requires a web server that takes in HTTP POST requests a single observation, or mini-batch, at a time. However, unlike real-time hosted endpoints which have persistent hardware (instances stay running until you shut them down), batch transform clusters are torn down when the job completes.\n",

    "We start by create an Athena query to get the test data from feature store. We can use [PyAthena](https://pypi.org/project/pyathena/) (a library that uses [Athena's REST API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) to connect to Athena and fetech query results) or [boto3 Athena](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/athena.html) (a low-level client representing Amazon Athena) to run queries that derive the feature sets from the Offline Feature Store. In this example, we can use CTAS statements to create new tables from existing tables on a subset of data, or a subset of columns. CTAS statements help reduce cost and improve performance by allowing users to run queries on smaller tables constructed from larger tables. When creating new tables using CTAS, you can include a WITH statement to define table-specific parameters, such as file format, compression, and partition columns. For more information, please refer to this [blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/using-ctas-statements-with-amazon-athena-to-reduce-cost-and-improve-performance/). Note that the first column will be the unique identifier of customer id and the second column is the target value.

In the `predict_fn`, we filter out the ID column and target column and convert the feature columns from dataframe to *DMatrix* data type for prediction.

However, by default the output data is compressed which means we cannot save the data directly as CSV format (but rather the compressed CSV format with 'gz' extension).
